# Background:

<details>
    <summary>reasons</summary>

There are many reasons for this project, some of them good some of them bad. All of them have to do with the general landscape of Discord right now and the way that Discord is treating *good* developers, and how developers are treating users and what discord is letting *bad* developers get away with.

</details>

We (royally) decided that we wanted to make a bot that is able to do everything any other bot can do, even if you were to pitch the idea of having several of them mashed together. There are some exceptions, like even though we impliment some command rate limiting and some command error logging, we will *not* be implimenting logging or Anti Nuke functionalities in this bot in the near future, possible never at all. if you would like the logging we suggest that you use [Sapphire](https://sapphire.xyz/?ref=awbot) if you need Anti Nuke we suggest you use [Wick](https://wickbot.com/?ref=awbot) and we want you to know we love both Xge and Fnaki and wish them nothing but the best
